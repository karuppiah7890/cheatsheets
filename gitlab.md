This is my cheatsheet for anything related to GitLab

1. How do I find what edition of GitLab I'm interacting with?

Go to `<gitlab-url>.com/help` and you will know. Example `https://gitlab.com/help`

2. How do I find what version of GitLab I'm interacting with?

Go to `<gitlab-url>.com/help` and you will know. Example `https://gitlab.com/help`

Note: Make sure you need login to be able to see the version!

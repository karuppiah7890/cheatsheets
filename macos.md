This is my cheatsheet for anything related to Mac OS

4. How do I navigate to the extreme right end of a line or extreme left end?

Use `Command + Left arrow` for extreme left

5. How do I navigate to the top (starting) of a doc / file or bottom (ending)?

Use `Command + Down arrow` for bottom

6. How do I navigate a line word by word towards right or left?

Use `Option + Right arrow` for navigating word by word to the right
Use `Option + Left arrow` for navigating word by word to the left

7. I try to update my Mac OS version using `Software Update` and click
`Update Now`. It does restart, but it never updates or gives any error! Why is
that?

I have noticed this to happen some two times now. I suspected the disk storage
space to be the issue - the OS not having enough free disk space in the system
to do it's upgrade automatically or even when you trigger manually. I fixed
this by checking my disk usage using `Disk Utility` and `Storage Management`.
Decrease it as much as possible to create more free disk space. The last time I
tried to upgrade, I made sure I had at least 15 - 16 GB free disk space - that
did the trick!
